## Stock Trading WebService Program (Fuzz Testing Target)
This project is a lightweight, standalone WebService program written in C/C++ , designed to simulate a stock trading system for use as a fuzz testing target . Built on top of the libhv networking library and cJSON JSON parsing library, it uses static CSV files to simulate real-time stock market data and supports basic functionalities such as querying quotes and submitting orders via HTTP APIs.

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a testbed for fuzzing tools , especially for evaluating the robustness and security of financial-grade web interfaces. It has no external dependencies or complex business logic, making it ideal for integration into fuzz testing platforms like AFL, libFuzzer, or Boofuzz.

## ðŸ§© Features
âœ… HTTP WebService : Provides RESTful API endpoints
âœ… Stock Quote Query Interface : Reads local CSV files to return simulated real-time stock data
âœ… Order Submission Interface : Accepts JSON-formatted order requests and returns responses
âœ… Fuzz-friendly Design : No external dependencies or complex business logic
âœ… Lightweight & Standalone : No reliance on databases or middleware, easy to deploy
